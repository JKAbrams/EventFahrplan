# This is a fork of EventFahrplan for HCPP 2019.

It does not use the backend software, instead it uses schedule-data from a simple .csv.
In the schedule folder is a script that produces a valid .xml file that the EventFahrplan can use.
Changed names and branding, otherwise nothing different from the original.

# Schedule data genreation script usage:
python csv2xml.py schedule.csv > hcpp19.xml
