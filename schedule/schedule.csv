1,14:00,01:00,Jiří Horáček,"Things which matter the most: reality, brain and consciousness","Linking physical reality, brain activity and consciousness still stands as one of the most interesting and elusive problems of neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry and philosophy. Finding their mutual relationships represents the first step toward explanation how the brain process external information and how the picture of reality in our mind relates the world.  In this lecture, I deal with two central questions of consciousness: how and why? “How” refers to the theoretical and empirical approach to reveal the neural correlates and mechanisms that form consciousness. On the other hand, “why” refers to both the evolutionary origin and the question why is there conscious experience at all.  The extraordinary states of consciousness elicited by the psychedelics, such as DMT, psilocybin and LSD, represent one of the most powerful tools for understanding neurobiology of consciousness and answering both “why” and “how” questions. The results of brain neuroimaging studies on the effect of psychedelic drugs on structure of consciousness provide an explanation for its phenomenological features, including unconstrained cognition, meaning of concepts of reality and a sense of expanded consciousness awareness. We will discuss how psychedelics, and other modern techniques such as neurostimulation, may increase cognitive flexibility and creativity, elucidate our understanding of the structure of external physical reality and enhance human potential in general.",Studio 1,Talks

New structures and new ways of living have to be built outside, and even though we’ve made a nice start, it has been just a small start. We have a long, long way to go.  We’re also guaranteed to face challenges on the outside, not only from bad people who may follow us there, but because none of us are fully developed, and we all carry some difficulties with us.  Being outside gives us space to build anew and to create better structures for ourselves, and then to improve ourselves. We’ll have to choose our actions well and we’ll have to work hard, but if we do, even the sky will be no limit.",Studio 1,Talks
1,19:00,01:00,Robin Hanson,Who Vouches For You?: A Radical Crime Law Proposal,"Most ancient societies used simple A-sues-B-for-cash legal systems to deal with most harms. But in the last few centuries, states added “crime law”, wherein the state investigates, sues, and imprisons “criminals.” These centrally-run one-size-fits-all bureaucratic systems don’t innovate well nor adapt well to individual conditions. And even though most of your “constitutional rights” are regarding such systems, they still seem badly broken.  In the ancient world, a stranger who came to town was trusted more if a local “vouched” for them. We still use vouching today in bonded contractors, in organized crime, and in requiring most everyone to get an insurer who pays on their behalf if they cause a car accident. I propose requiring everyone to get an insurer to vouch for them regarding any crimes they might commit. If you are found guilty of a crime, your “voucher” pays the state a fine, and then pays to punish you according to your contract with them. This fine in part pays the private bounty-hunter who convinced the court of your guilt. Competing bounty-hunters obey law because they can’t maintain a blue-wall-of-silence.  To lower your voucher premiums, you might agree to (1) prison, torture, or exile, if caught, (2) prior limits on your freedom like curfews, ankle bracelets, and their reading your emails, and (3) co-liability wherein you and your buddies are all punished if any one of you is found guilty. In this system, the state still decides what behaviors are crimes and if any one accusation is true, and it sets fine and bounty levels regarding how hard to discourage and detect each kind of crime. But each person chooses their own “constitutional rights”, and vouchers acquire incentives and opportunity to innovate and adapt, by searching in a large space of ways to discourage crime.",Studio 1,Talks

Humans have been trying to overcome (or suppress) their nature by creating moral standards, rules, by means of which they could judge each other and decide whether to build the interaction further or to refuse and disrupt the communication.  For the last decades we have been trying to apply our ethics and moral principles to other types of agents - artificial ones, in order to judge them and be capable of reacting accordingly. But do computers have the nature similar to ours that would make the application possible? Will the nature of interaction between artificial and biological agents be the same as human-to-human? Will AI have a goodwill to politely ask us to cooperate before tearing down our barbed wire fences? ",Institute of Cryptoanarchy,Talks

1,17:00,01:00,Marketa Dolejsova,“Of Course There Are Risks Involved But It Is My Body After All”: Paradoxes of Personalized Nutrition & Diet Hacking,"Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius said in the 1st century BC that what is food to one, may be bitter poison to others. In 2019, hyperconnected, health-focused consumers return to this premise and claim the obsolescence of one-size-fits-all dietary guidelines in favor of personalized nutrition (PN) approaches. Drawing on the recent advances in self-quantification technologies, affordable machine learning, and genome sequencing techniques, PN practitioners experiment with food products and services tailored to their individual lifestyle preferences as well as phenotypic and genotypic traits. ​These practitioners are often motivated by their distrust in official dietary recommendations issued by food and health authorities, and prefer a knowledge derived through self-experimentation. By measuring and quantifying their everyday food intake and outtake, they aim to develop a — supposedly precise — data-driven understanding of their bodies and diets. ​PN provides opportunities for empowered human-food relationships but also risks regarding limited scientific validity, health safety, and data security.  This talk presents findings from our long-term research on emerging PN technologies, practices, and issues. I will discuss a three-year ethnographic study of the ​Complete Foods​ community of ‘diet hackers’ replacing their daily meals with personalized food powders, and share insights from our recent ​DNA Diets​ project exploring the risks and opportunities of gene-based PN. The ​Complete Foods​ (CF) study ​(2014-2017) involved interviews with 65 ​CF dieters, a content analysis of three ​CF​ ​community forums, and two autoethnographic self-experiments where I probed the opportunities and limitations of the diet on myself. The ​DNA Diets​ study initiated in 2019, involves experiments with the Promethease service enabling a DIY analysis of personal DNA test reports, and crafting of dinner menus tailored to my and collaborator’s genetic codes. ​Findings from both case studies will be discussed within the broader context of food-tech innovation and data-driven optimization of everyday food and health practices.",Institute of Cryptoanarchy,Talks

The big one and globally significant. You understand its urgency and you would like to solve it. And you are alone, or there is only few of you. So what can you do? Get involved in politics. Initiate the protests or get involved in the existing ones. Will you succeed? Maybe or maybe not.  There is also another way of investing your time and energy - start the change on your own. Get a couple of similar minded people and start working on practical solutions. Make the first prototype. Then, address the relevant community with it and analyze the feedback. Learn, develop and scale after then.  As a members of Paralelni Polis community, we were surrounded by several environmental clichés, mostly about the eco-unfriendly cryptocurrency mining. Actually, their substance was similar to many others environmental issues: many debates and only a few practically-based conclusions with very poor impact. So, we decided to take action. We built up our first hydroponic system, start cooperation with hackerspace in order to include automation. And start the path to automated rooftop greenhouse. We also open-sourced all of our know-how in order to make it spread as far as possible. The accurate feedback on the effect of our actions was substantial to us - so we refused state-based financial sources and emphasize the peer-to-peer relation. We will be happy to share our story with you! In the meantime, we don 't waste time and iterate!

1,15:00,01:00,Petr Lupač,Constructing parallel opt-out infrastructures: A sociological contribution,"We are deeply entrenched in numerous socio-technological systems that structure our everyday life. They function by channelling, prohibiting, controlling, limiting, categorizing, standardizing (…) our behaviour. Just count how many of these systems you have “joined/used” to this very day.  Current ideas and attempts at finding a technological solution to help us opt out from this “first constrained realm” are not entirely novel. In light of this congress, the one most worth considering is the very notion of a decentralized and free computer network, one which should catalyse a positive societal revolution and leave behind the evils of centralised and alienating state-corporate systems.  By employing a sociological approach (namely sociology of technology), we will look at what went wrong in the socio-technical history of the free computer network project and examine how the resulting system forms new hard-to-escape dependencies.  Was A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace too early, just in time or too late? Is it even possible to construct a technological infrastructure to opt out of “the first realm“? Which sociological criteria would facilitate an opt-out system? And lastly, how are new dependencies formed when two parallel systems meet? ",Slévárna,Talks

1,18:00,01:00,Matthias Tarasiewicz,"The past, present and future of Opt-Out with Open and Libre Hardware","FOSH (Free and Open Source Hardware) in the past years has moved away from being a small niche and has developed to a relevant movement with significant and well-known projects. Open Science Hardware offers an opt-out potential against centralisation, as visible in the ""Safecast""

Crowd Science Geiger Counter, which offered concerned people a chance to fact-check radiation levels after the Fukushima incident in Japan.

Open Hardware has a success story to tell - but what does ""open"" in this context mean? How open can hardware be, post the age of microcomputing? Verifiable hardware could even help future nuclear disarming (see 34C3, ""Vintage Computing for Trusted Radiation Measurements and a World Free of Nuclear Weapons""). In contrast, the actual hardware landscape is neither very open, nor verifiable.

Additionally, HSMs and TEEs are challenging zero-trust by introducing novel attack vectors. Mistrust in modern day processors are growing, especially after “Spectre”, “Foreshadow” and “Spoiler”. Full Opt-Out possibility is presently not possible, Free and Open Source Silicon can the first step to a Zero-Trust society - but the future remains speculative.

2,14:00,01:00,Ken Schoolland,The Oldest and Most Feared Opt-Out Strategy: Migration,"Throughout history and around the world people have been 1) intent on controlling others; 2) content to be controlled; and 3) determined to be free of control by others. The latter group is constantly seeking and preparing contingencies for their own eventual and necessary escape to freedom. This can be aided by contemplating the paths taken by more than 240 million others in recent years with varying degrees of success. And surely the numbers would be much greater except for the multitude and measure of the obstacles.

Some paths to freedom are crude and unsophisticated, but nonetheless imaginative and brazen. The most apparent and direct way to avoid the clutches of tyranny is to physically move to places of relatively less tyranny. The movement of great numbers of people around the planet evokes passions of both courage and fear with all the consequent conflict and trauma for leavers & remainers as well as for inviters & excluders.

Ironically, much of the desperation of people in poor countries is aggravated by some, perhaps well-intentioned but calamitous, behavior by governments in prosperous countries: i.e. trade manipulations, drug wars, and assistance to foreign rulers. This assistance to rulers includes the closing of escape routes. Likewise, well-intentioned domestic government assistance and a multitude of labor and commercial laws have forcefully aggravated the adjustment and tolerance of migration into relatively prosperous and free countries.

Of many models possible as a solution to these dilemmas of migration, Hong Kong provides useful historical lessons that are practical, humanitarian, and ethical from a libertarian perspective.",Studio 1,Talks

It this kind of nonsense question or are we heading to the world without physical barriers? We started to develop this technology in 60s, so many could remember Ivan Sutherland experimenting with head mounted display. Today researchers, engineers and developers are looking for new challenges in delivering this technology to public. But what does it really mean for us? What happens to virtual reality when it merges with idea of decentralization and blockchain? Within this panel discussion we would like to discuss a few topic related to virtual reality and its application.

We will introduce three projects:
Decentraland - a virtual reality platform supported by the Ethereum Blockchain. Users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications. The community permanently owns land in Decentraland, so they have full control over their creations. Users claim ownership of virtual land in a block-based package of packages. Landowners control what content is published in their land.
Michal Takáč - former Decentraland employee, PhD student at Technical University in Košice, board member at Paralelná Polis Košice, entrepreneur and software engineer with passion for new technologies. Currently exploring VR/AR possibilities, interested in smart cities, smart home technologies, cryptocurrencies, smart contracts.

Somnium Space - an open, social and persistent VR world built on the blockchain where everyone can buy land, build or import objects and avatars, easily monetize their experiences and immerse themselves into completely alternative reality. The long-term vision is to create a virtual environment which offers a rich addition to reality, packed with new and exciting possibilities. Built as a cross-platform world, Somnium Space allows people to experience one constantly expanding, seamless single instance shaped by players. Combined with an in-world economy, it provides a next step towards a true metaverse experience.
Artur Sychov - he worked as an investment trader for years before becoming a serial entrepreneur. He is a Founder and CEO of Somnium Space and an angel investor. He has founded several startups and holds several patents for hardware inventions which he has implemented into the market. Artur strongly believes in the ultimate future of virtual worlds.

NeosVR - an innovative metaverse engine designed to accelerate the development of social VR applications. It is built on top of a novel scripting engine that integrates engine logic, synchronization and asynchronous job and asset processing into a seamless whole.
This gives creators, engineers, developers or scientists the ability to focus on the behavior of their creations and what makes them unique, with automatic support for a wide variety of VR devices, online collaboration/multiplayer and cloud functionality, both for the development and the project.

Karel Hulec - futurist, generalist and enthusiastic tech analytic to the bone, who has always had a knack for combining business and technology.

This talk starts with the familiar political map of the world to show what the bold colours and clear boundaries conceal rather than reveal: a multitude of unrecognised and unnoticed states whose claims to legitimacy are deliberately made invisible. This is the shadowy, surprisingly large, and literally unofficial world of countries that don’t exist.

Based on his best-selling book of the same title, acclaimed travel writer and Oxford geography don, Nick Middleton, takes us on an eye-opening journey through this parallel world. These are wannabe countries that, lacking diplomatic recognition or UN membership, inhabit a realm of shifting borders, idealistic leaders and forgotten peoples. But although the places covered in this talk lie beyond the margins of legitimacy, virtually all can be visited in the real world.

Filled with stories, facts and figures, this is simultaneously an insight into the power of territorial countries, an introduction to creating your own nation state, and a bucket list of destinations from an alternative dimension. Above all, it’s an assortment of yearning tales of nationhood, most led by visionary leaders: some sad, some mad, some downright bizarre.",Studio 1,Talks

2,13:00,01:00,Travin Keith,The Dehumanizing Process of Immigration Systems,"Numerous immigration systems around the world are broken. Though part of the reason is due to illegal immigration, a significant amount remains fixable, but isn't, due to the fact that most citizens of countries are never exposed to the problem, and most legal immigrants, sometimes known as an expat, either prefer to not do anything about it, perhaps out of fear of being mistreated, or are not able to influence change. Because of this, many problems remain that reduce the value of an individual and their own merits to where they were born, something that they have no control over, that cause burdensome processes that stifle business growth and economic freedom, or outright rejection. This presentation will go over relevant data from immigration policies around the world as well as personal experiences from the speaker, a former digital nomad who has traveled to 31 countries and lived in 8 of them, all while holding a passport of a country with a Global Passport Ranking of 133 out of 199 countries.",Slévárna,Talks
2,14:00,01:00,Juraj Bednár,Financial surveillance and crypto utopias,"In a world where financial surveillance is a norm and banking secrecy is gone, what are our option? And how does the surveillance apparatus really work?

The introduction of global regulations on financial transactions had a profound effect. As far as we know, no terrorists were caught because of them. Banking secrecy is gone. It is more difficult to conduct international business. International transactions are being examined and blocked. Commerce is slowing down. The banks are running a police station for the state, enforcing a regulation that is not clear. Conducting international business has become unpredictable.

This creates the value proposition for cryptocurrencies. They bring back privacy, the speed of transactions and are regulated by code, not international agreements. They are difficult to confiscate, some of them are fast, most of them are cheap. And some of them are anonymous. Are cryptocurrencies the next step in the evolution of the financial sector? Or is it a parallel solution to a pressing issue?

This talk looks at the development of financial surveillance. It looks at current financial surveillance and risk management systems. It covers the best use-cases for cryptocurrencies and their value proposition. They are not speculation for gamblers, but a solution to a new pressing issue.",Slévárna,Talks

Mr. Park will talk about the genesis of this unique delivery method for information dissemination into North Korea; how and what changes these USBs cause inside North Korea when the citizens view them; how this delivery method, while very low-tech, is one way of 'hacking' the regime and bypassing the North Korean regime's control to send not only humanitarian aid, but more importantly, information directly to the people inside North Korea; and how others can get involved and participate in this project, which is the only regularly scheduled and carried out work in terms of information dissemination into North Korea.",Slévárna,Talks

We are all capable of assessing our needs, we are all capable of building a world shaped by those who live in it, rather than those who enjoy the privileged seats assigned to them.

Regulations are pushing to create boundaries for us to play in. Like obsessive parents, we are being told to play within the limits of their vision. As though the rules they had assigned us had done us any good thus far. The failure to see and acknowledge this has been the root cause of our perish.

This talk starts with the familiar political map of the world to show what the bold colours and clear boundaries conceal rather than reveal: a multitude of unrecognised and unnoticed states whose claims to legitimacy are deliberately made invisible. This is the shadowy, surprisingly large, and literally unofficial world of countries that don’t exist.

Based on his best-selling book of the same title, acclaimed travel writer and Oxford geography don, Nick Middleton, takes us on an eye-opening journey through this parallel world. These are wannabe countries that, lacking diplomatic recognition or UN membership, inhabit a realm of shifting borders, idealistic leaders and forgotten peoples. But although the places covered in this talk lie beyond the margins of legitimacy, virtually all can be visited in the real world.

Filled with stories, facts and figures, this is simultaneously an insight into the power of territorial countries, an introduction to creating your own nation state, and a bucket list of destinations from an alternative dimension. Above all, it’s an assortment of yearning tales of nationhood, most led by visionary leaders: some sad, some mad, some downright bizarre.",Slévárna,Talks

Lead by Pavel ""i_a"" Polach

Effective digital privacy demands complex approach to all interactions in cyberspace. Anonymity of financial transactions, secure messaging and file encryption are main cornerstones and for many people, dedicated secure hardware device is essential to obtain such level of digital privacy.

RMX device aims to bring this approach to the space by including Secure end-to-end encrypted messenger, AES file encryption device and Monero hardware wallet into one device equipped with native alphanumeric keyboard. Use of hardware accelerated cryptographical primitives allows RMX to become fast multi-purpose platform. This feature also enables RMX's accelerated ed25519 elliptic curve multiplication to synchronize the Monero wallet quickly and moreover - without leaking the private key.

The open-source nature of the project together with relevant community participating in iterations and debuging process ensures the possible weaknesses will be eliminated. Community is crucial from the very beginning - more testers will participate, more issues can be solved before the production scaling.Incentivizing the community to participate is the principal intention behind this talk – RMX device prototypes will be available, so come, have a look at them and share your opinion!

A multitude of methods to prevent theft or at least make it harder have been developed over the years – several generations of hardware wallets, paper wallets, various elaborate cold storage systems etc. pp.. 2FA tokens for remote system access and similar devices are very similar in their properties. But they all have one weakness: if an attacker gains physical possession, the security margin shrinks – often too far. Even if an attacker can not reverse engineer the secrets out of access tokens or hardware wallets, he can manipulate the computing devices you use them with, gain valuable information through surveillance or trick you into doing stupid stuff. So the necessary protection envelope is bigger than you may think. This talk will take a look at how real-world attacks against offline and online devices are carried out these days, discuss how to develop an adequate threat model for your needs, explain some basics (like the difference between ""tamper evident"" and ""tamper resistant"") as well as typical pitfalls in this game.

BIO
Jason is a training engineer with SUSE Linux in Prague. He specializes in writing training materials for container-based applications including Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry. He is also deeply interested in keeping speech free even in places where it is illegal and so he is also interested in how Tor can help with that goal.

ABSTRACT - Building Tor Onion Services Quickly and Securely Using Containers
What is Tor? Is it merely a place for criminals to hide out on the so called ""Dark Web""? Are onion services nothing more than tools to hide illegal pornography and host drug markets? We'll answer these questions as well as learn how to make simple onion services using Linux containers in my presentation. // The Crpto-Anarchist Manifesto speaks of, ""the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner"". The goal of my presentation is to help enable individuals with the means to do this via Tor. Currently setting up an anonymous Tor onion service is not very difficult but does it take time to understand how the pieces work together. Using the Docker container method, we can minimize complexity and allow new onion services to be brought online quickly and securely. The end result I hope to accomplish is to allow people to communicate peacefully and anonymously without fear from governments and others who will not allow the free exchange of ideas.",Institute of Cryptoanarchy,Lightning Talks

Rapid loss of biodiversity has been overshadowed by ongoing world debate about climate changes with outcomes of so called “global warming”. Governments and multinational NGOs are claiming their efforts in reducing carbon emissions in order to prove their commitments and transferring money between climate funds with very small real impact. But unfortunately we are losing whole species without further notice and no one knows which of these species loose may be the fatal one. If we look precisely into the core of the problems we can identify many small actions which can be taken to have a big impact. We will demonstrate you how small changes in to the old systems using high-tech can cause big impact on species survival for example with critically endangered sea turtles. Species conservation is now opening to decentralised leadership and may become a field for successful implementation of blockchain technology, local communities may uberised the acts for wildlife and get benefits accordingly. There is a long journey of full decentralisation in biodiversity conservation, but it is time to start now.
